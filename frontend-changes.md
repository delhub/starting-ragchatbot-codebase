# Frontend Changes

## Overview
This document tracks changes made to the frontend during the code quality tools implementation.

## Changes Made
**Note**: This feature implementation focused on backend Python code quality tools. No frontend changes were made as the RAG chatbot uses vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, which was not in scope for this Python-focused quality tooling implementation.

The following backend improvements were made that support the overall development workflow:

1. **Code Formatting**: All Python files have been formatted with black and isort
2. **Quality Scripts**: Development scripts were added for maintaining code quality
3. **Configuration**: Quality tool configurations were added to the project

## Frontend Files Status
- `frontend/index.html`: No changes
- `frontend/script.js`: No changes
- `frontend/styles.css`: No changes

All frontend files remain unchanged. Future frontend quality improvements could include:
- ESLint for JavaScript linting
- Prettier for JavaScript/CSS formatting
- JSDoc for documentation
